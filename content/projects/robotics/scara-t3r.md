# Analysis of SCARA Robot & Modelling of T3R Robot

**Type:** Academic project (Robotics course)
**Timeline:** ~2020

---

## Summary

Two-part robotics project: mathematical analysis of a SCARA robot arm and 3D modelling of a T3R robot in SolidWorks.

---

## SCARA Robot Analysis

### Forward & Inverse Kinematics
- Computed Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters for the SCARA robot
- Used DH parameters to formulate forward kinematics
- Derived inverse kinematics solutions

### Dynamics
- Used Lagrange-Euler formulation to compute the torque/dynamics of the robot

### Trajectory Planning
- Planned an arbitrary trajectory for the SCARA manipulator

---

## T3R Robot Modelling

- **Configuration:** 1 twisting joint + 3 revolute joints (T3R)
- Modelled using **SolidWorks**
- Bonus task: attempting to interface the SolidWorks model with **MATLAB Simscape**
