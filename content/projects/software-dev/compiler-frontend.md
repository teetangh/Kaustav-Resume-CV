# Compiler Frontend for Subset of C-Language

**Type:** Academic project (Compiler Design course)
**Timeline:** ~2021 (added to git Jan 2021)
**Language:** C

---

## Summary

Built a compiler frontend consisting of a lexical analyser, symbol table generator, and recursive descent parser for a subset of the C programming language.

---

## Components

### Lexical Analyser
- Extracts tokens from a C source file
- Identifies keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and delimiters
- Source: `Sem05-Compiler-Design-LAB/LAB 04/lab04_symbol_table_lexical_analyser_complete.c`

### Symbol Table Generator
- Stores information about identifiers and functions
- Tracks scope, type, and declaration information

### Recursive Descent Parser
- Semantically parses grammar for a subset of C-Language
- Analyzes tokens generated by the lexical analyser
- Reports syntactic and semantic errors
- Source: `Sem05-Compiler-Design-LAB/LAB 0789/lab09_RDP_main.c`
