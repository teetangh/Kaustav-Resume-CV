## Games

### Crossword Solver
- Takes a 10x10 grid and a word list
- Outputs the grid with words accurately filled in valid positions
- Source: `CodeZen/03 Algorithms and Competitive Programming/11 Backtracking/prog004crosswordSolver.cpp`

### Sudoku Solver
- Takes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid
- Outputs a solution where every row, column, and nine 3x3 sub-grids contains exactly one instance of digits 1-9
- Uses XOR logic for constraint checking
- Source: `CodeChef/Public/Code Marathon/sudokuSolver.cpp`
