# Microsoft Student Partners — ML Bootcamp

**Type:** Team ML project (internship deliverable)
**Timeline:** Apr -- Jun 2020
**Language:** Python
**Team Size:** 10

## Summary

End-to-end machine learning pipeline for used car price prediction. Led a team of 10 through EDA, feature engineering, and model building.

---

## Pipeline

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data wrangling and preprocessing using NumPy and Pandas
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Gathered useful insights from the dataset

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Univariate and multivariate filtering techniques
- Mutual entropy gain filtering
- Feature selection using RMSE regression
- Feature selection using ANOVA tests

### 3. Model Building
- Built the final model using **XGBoost Regressor**

### Mini Project (Bonus)
- Extensive data visualization and analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn
