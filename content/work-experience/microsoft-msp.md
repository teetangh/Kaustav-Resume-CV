# Microsoft Student Partners — Machine Learning Internship

**Role:** Machine Learning Intern
**Timeline:** Apr 2020 -- Jun 2020
**Certificates:** ML Certificate, Python Foundations Certificate

---

## Summary

Led a team of 10 in a machine learning bootcamp organized by Microsoft Student Partners. Built an end-to-end ML pipeline for a regression task.

---

## Key Deliverables

### Team Leadership
- Guided a team of 10 individuals to collaborate and accomplish the project
- Coordinated work across EDA, feature engineering, and model building phases

### Used Car Price Prediction (Major Project)
- Regression task: predicting prices of used cars
- Pipeline stages:
  1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — data wrangling and processing using NumPy and Pandas, visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn
  2. **Feature Engineering** — detected most important attributes using:
     - Univariate and multivariate filtering techniques
     - Mutual entropy gain filtering
     - Feature selection using RMSE regression and ANOVA tests
  3. **Model Building** — built the ML model using XGBoost Regressor

### Mini Project
- Extensive data visualization and analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gather useful insights from the data
