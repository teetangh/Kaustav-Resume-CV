# Qbotics Labs — ROS Engineer Internship

**Role:** ROS Engineer Intern
**Location:** Remote
**Timeline:** Jul 2020 -- Aug 2020
**Mentor:** Lentin Joseph (CEO, author of 8 ROS books)

---

## Summary

Internship focused on building and simulating differential drive robots using ROS (Robot Operating System), Gazebo, and Webots. Learned end-to-end robot construction from URDF modeling to sensor integration to motion planning.

---

## Key Deliverables

### Differential Drive Construction
- Constructed a differential drive with caster wheel from scratch using URDF and XACRO files
- Mounted sensors: laser scanner, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Velodyne Puck VLP-16 Lidar

### Gazebo Simulation
- Simulated the differential drive in Gazebo
- Wrote ROS Subscriber scripts to get laser scan readings from sensor messages for obstacle range detection

### Google Cartographer Integration
- Interfaced the differential drive with Google Cartographer for localization and mapping (SLAM)
- Configured using Lua config files

### Webots Simulation
- Modelled a 4-wheeled drive and an environment for experimentation of various controllers in Webots 3D Robot Simulator
- Wrote individual C++ controllers for:
  - Teleoperation using keyboard
  - Laser scanner
  - GPS
  - IMU
  - Linear actuator

### Documentation
- Wrote Markdown documentation for the entirety of the internship for beginners to understand concepts and replicate results
